How to try
================================================================================

1. If `scapex` is not installed, add it in your `PATH` for a temporary test:

```bash
source .env
```

2. Use the `Makefile` to perform the default exportation:

```bash
make
```

3. Take a look at `scapex --help`, the `Makefile`, and `../doc/logo.toml` to see how options are fragments/animations are setup!
